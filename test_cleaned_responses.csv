"RM aka Kim Namjoon was the first member to join BTS. The group released their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool on June 12, 2013. Apart from RM, BTS also features Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. In an interview with Hypebeast, RM said, ""This is the most difficult question to answer truthfully. Recently, I watched Everything Everywhere All At Once. That film visualized many of the ideas that I’ve had, such as the idea about multiple versions of myself existing based on small choices I made. I often think about what it would have been like if I continued my studies or became something other than a musician."" ""To be honest, one decision that I had often thought about was my choice to become a part of a boy band. In the late 2000s, musicians like Zico, Changmo, and Giriboy were the people that I started out with. In my journey with BTS, I drifted further and further away from that world and was tormented by the thought that the people that I liked – and the people who enjoyed the same music as I – did not have any love for me. I often wondered whether I made the right decision by joining a boy band. At the time, BTS, was treated like a complete outsider in the Korean hip-hop community. That stressed me out. I was constantly thinking about how I would be able to overcome that perception and how to define music or hip-hop,” he added. RM released his first solo mixtape in 2015. Three years later, he released his second mixtape, Mono. RM has collaborated with artists such as Wale, Younha, Warren G, Gaeko, Krizz Kaliko, MFBTY, Fall Out Boy, Primary, Lil Nas X, Erykah Badu, and Anderson .Paak. Earlier this month, RM released his first full-length solo album Indigo.","Word Count: 307, Sentence Count: 17, Avg Sentence Length: 18.06, Avg Word Length: 4.52","rm aka kim namjoon was the first member to join bts. apart from rm, bts also features jin, suga, j-hope, jimin, v, and jungkook. i often think about what it would have been like if i continued my studies or became something other than a musician.""

"Blackpink is on Born Pink World Tour right now. The girls – Rose, Jennie, Jisoo and Lisa are in Hamilton performing at the First Ontario centre.

Clips are naturally going viral, and Blackpink’s energies and vibes are high and resonating far and wide. Everyone is gushing and crushing over Jennie, Lisa, Jisoo and Rose performing on stage. Some of the clips from Blackpink’s Born Pink World Tour’s soundcheck in Ontario are also going viral The phrase Blackpink in Hamilton is a big trend on Twitter and in Hollywood News. One of the biggest girl bands Blackpink enjoys a massive fan-following across the globe. Talking about their concert in Ontario, be it Jisoo's cuteness to Lisa's pole dance and Jennie oozing hotness, Blinks are going crazy over how Blackpink are taking over Hamilton. Lisa's performance on Money is also one of the highlights. Blackpink performed on various songs including DDU-DU DDU-DU, Kill This Love, Typa Girl, Forever Young and more. Clips are being shared online The Blackpink World Tour concert began in Seoul wherein the girls – Jennie, Lisa, Jisoo and Rose – performed their first concert. The girls performed their opening for the World Tour for the first time in four years. Clips went viral days later over the mistake in Blackpink's choreography while on stage. It caused controversy.

"BTS members - RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook - also known as the Bangtan Boys have been ruling the hearts since 2013, their debut showcase. And those who got to know about the Bangtannies now and are yet to explore their initial days are in for a treat. BTS members have been helluva goofy ever since they started training. And today, we are here with a throwback video of BTS members from the Dark & Wild era. Once, the Bangtan Boys dropped a video on Bangtan TV wherein they turned a corridor into their ramp and flaunted their OTT ramp walk A year after their debut, the BTS members - RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook - switched on their crazy side and decided to pretend to walk the ramp. It was late in the night, and the boys were in for some mischief and some fun it seems. They turned a corridor of their room into a ramp and pretended to be models and showcased their 'walks'. Of course, each of them went OTT and it's only going to leave the ARMY, laughing out loud The Bangtan Bomb video begins with Suga aka Min Yoongi. He oozes swag in his walk but it's certainly OTT. The posture he strikes before walking back will make you think whether he really is the calm and cool Yoongi. Up next is Jimin aka Park Jimin. He is like a bratty kid left loose in the park who tries to be a bully but backs off because, Jimin's kiddo, after all After Jimin, it's Jungkook aka the Golden Maknae's turn. It seems someone pushed Jungkook on the ramp forcefully. And now, he has to make it look cool. Jungkook looked like the kid who would brag but it's all just false pretence.  Towards the end, JK strikes the spiderman-style pose and it's hilarious. Next, we have is J-Hope aka Jung Hoseok. He's got the style in his walk but later goofs it up with his real personality. J-Hope is the funniest in this one. The fourth member to walk the corridor ramp is V aka Kim Taehyung. And y'all would know how much Taetae loves being extra! His dance before walking back would make you think if he's possessed or something. However, V ends it pretty smoothly It's RM's turn to walk the ramp. But instead of walking, he's just jumping around like an overexcited kid in the whole lot who later gets conscious and calms the hell down. Next comes the conjuring X star Jin, walking with the up in the bow pose, in the scariest manner. He falls down and but gets up only to walk in the most threatening manner as though challenging people to laugh. Lastly, they all walk the ramp, we mean, the corridor together. Taehyung, J-Hope, Jimin and Jungkook are still being extra while Jin turns into a cool kid. Suga seems to be trying to kick off the pain of his joints while RM's still conscious of his ramp walk. Watch the goofy and funny throwback BTS video here: It's been nine years since BTS' debut. And though they have considerably matured and evolved as people, they still are childish somewhere.

"Rapper Snoop Dogg has confirmed his collaboration with K-pop group BTS for an upcoming project. In a recent interview, Snoop Dogg said that their collab is official like 'a referee with a whistle'. He also said that BTS makes good music and so does he. BTS comprises RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. Earlier in January, Snoop Dogg revealed that BTS had asked him for a collaboration. This is not the first time that BTS will be collaborating with a solo artist. The group has so far collaborated with Steve Aoki, The Chainsmokers, Nicki Minaj, Halsey, Lauv, Coldplay, Megan Thee Stallion among others. Recently, speaking with The AV Club, Snoop Dogg said, “The BTS experience you keep talking about. I’m going to let them tell you about it. It’s official like a referee with a whistle. I love that entertainment world. It’s good music. It’s [a] vibe. I make good music. They make good music. And we end up doing this. This is what it’s always about, bringing our worlds together.” Earlier this year, Snoop Dogg told Mogul Talk podcast, “I got a group named BTS that's waiting on me to do a song with them right now. And I'm trying to figure out if I got time to do that s***.” Another guest from the show, Crystal Mais had said, “That would be fire. BTS is dope. The K-pop market is huge, Snoop. Do it.” BTS had first hinted at their admiration for the 50-year-old rapper when they included a nod to his debut album Doggystyle in their 2014 track Hip Hop Phile.

"Fans of BTS had high hopes from Grammys 2021 and 2022 when BTS got nominations for Dynamite and Butter. Sadly, the K-Pop kings did not win on both the occasions. Dynamite lost to Ariana Grande and Lady Gaga. On the other hand, Butter lost to SZA and Doja Cat's Kiss Me More. The second loss was highly debatable as the song Kiss Me More is a collaboration when BTS was nominated in group category. Well, it seems BTS might have a strong presence at Grammys 2023 as well. As per Gold Derby, a portal that specialises in predictions for Grammys/Oscars and Emmys said that Coldplay and BTS' My Universe can be nominated in the Best Pop Duo/Group performance at the Grammys. But the bigger news is that Jungkook and Charlie Puth also stand to get nominated in the same category Well, Coldplay and BTS' My Universe deserves a nomination for Best Music Video. The futuristic style video is one of the best to come out in 2021. On the other hand, Jungkook and Charlie Puth's Left and Right is the summer bop of 2022. Jungkook has also been declared as artist of the summer by some music portals. BTS fans aka ARMYs are super kicked about the news. The year has been a super special one with solo debuts of the band members. Jung Hoseok aka J-Hope also delivered a critically acclaimed album with Jack In The Box This is indeed big news for all fans of BTS.

"&lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; is BTS&rsquo; fame variety show which used to be a weekly catch-up between the group and their fans as the septet tried on different activities to entertain the fans.

Run BTS! 2023 Special Episode Next Top Genius&nbsp;

The upcoming episode has been named, &lsquo;Run BTS! 2023 Special Episode Next Top Genius&rsquo;, and the teaser introduced the chaos that will unfold a week later. The seven members gathered in front of a table setting, ready to play a game of cards. It is likely that more than one game will be played in this episode, which will see the BTS members put their mind to test. With everyone bluffing, it is only natural that they are after the real liar. In another game, it seems as though brain movement/thought-sensitive headbands were placed on their heads with cat ears adding to their adorableness. X and O paddle in their hands, and they test out each other. A shocking revelation seems to await the fans at the end of the upcoming &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; special episode.
NrfFsgWSpQUWhile &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; took a break in October last year, it returned a few months ago in August much to the delight of the BTS ARMY.

With seven cars, each carrying one of them to different locations, they were handed keywords that would steer them towards certain spots engraved in their memory. The game ends once all of them are at the same spot. The whole of Seoul at their disposal, once again their telepathy skills were questioned. Meeting and separating, laughing and reminiscing, do they finally all end up at the same location?

Run BTS! 2022 Special Episode - Fly BTS Fly

Putting member Jungkook&rsquo;s idea into action, one that he mentioned offhandedly as the others were also throwing random thoughts for upcoming &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; episodes, the South Korean superstars headed to try their hand, or should we say mind and boy, at flying yoga. Usually, an activity demonstrated by a female trainer, a skilled young man who was at the receiving end of BTS&rsquo; admiration, trained them at difficult moves. Their one aim? To take Instagrammable photos. And so the grunts and cries for help ensued as the flexible ones like Jimin and Jungkook put their best foot forward while the rest struggled to stay in position. It created hilarious content full of laughter and words of praise from the members for each other as well as for the trainer who was previously seen teaching TOMORROW X TOGETHER. Some BTS members also shared the photos they worked so hard for on Instagram later on.

"BTS consists of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook&mdash;co-writes and co-produces much of their own material. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres; their lyrics have often discussed mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, and individualism. Their work also frequently references literature, philosophy and psychological concepts, and includes an alternate universe storyline.

BTS in the beginning:

After launching in 2013 with their single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS respectively released their first Korean-language studio album, Dark &amp; Wild, and Japanese-language studio album, Wake Up, in 2014. The group&#39;s second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS had crossed into the global music market, leading the Korean wave into the United States and breaking several sales records. They became the first Korean ensemble to receive a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single Mic Drop, as well as the first act from South Korea to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018).&nbsp;

BTS&#39; achievements:&nbsp;

BTS became one of the few groups since the Beatles in 1966&ndash;1968 with four US number-one albums in less than two years, and Love Yourself: Answer (2018) was the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200 with their Grammy-nominated single Dynamite. Their follow-up releases Savage Love, Life Goes On, Butter, and Permission to Dance made them the quickest act to earn four US number-one singles since Justin Timberlake in 2006.

BTS in 2022:

As of 2022, BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history, having sold in excess of 30 million albums via the Circle Chart, and their studio album Map of the Soul: 7 (2020) is the best-selling album of all time in South Korea. They are the first non-English-speaking and Asian act to hold sold-out concerts at Wembley Stadium and the Rose Bowl (Love Yourself World Tour in 2019), and were named the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry&#39;s (IFPI) Global Recording Artist of the Year for both 2020 and 2021.

"BTS members Jungkook and Kim Taehyung are now out of Korea. The former is in Qatar where he will be performing at the Al Bayt Stadium for the opening of the FIFA World Cup 2022. His presence is creating some controversy as Dua Lipa has opted out saying that she does not support the restrictions on the LGBT community. ICYMI, homosexuality is considered to be criminal offence in Qatar. The officials have said that while the LGBTQ community is welcome, they cannot campaign like holding pride flags and so on. There are rumors that even Shakira might skip the opening ceremony of the World Cup 2022 due to some personal issues. This means that BTS Jungkook will be one of the biggest acts for the day. He has already gone there for rehearsals and recording his parts for the tournament As we know, the Run BTS choreography is going viral everywhere. Jungkook has done a cute version of it and shared on his Insta stories. He is seen in black baggy pants and a white shirt. TaeKook fans are happy as even Taehyung shared a small video from his hotel in Paris. We can see him shirtless on bed TaeKook fans are over the moon seeing their two faves post at the same time. The Run BTS Tik Tok is viral and how. We have seen Yeonjun from TXT do it, as has Hoshi from SEVENTEEN.

"Run BTS announced its first drop in the new year with a new version of the highly popular variety show that brings together one of the biggest acts of the planet in their most real and fun state  Titled &lsquo;Run BTS! 2023 Special Episode Next Top Genius&rsquo;, the teaser foreshadowed a group time with unlimited laughter incoming for the BTS ARMY 

Pizza time

Celebrity chef Paik Jong Won, who has previously worked with the South Korean group for another &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; episode, has become friends with the members, especially the oldest, Jin  In fact, the chef and the singer decided to have their own short variety show named &lsquo;Drunken Truth&rsquo; where they handmade some alcohol  Paik Jong Won sent some delicious pizzas from his brand to the BTS members who devoured them 

V and Jungkook&rsquo;s predicament

While the hyungs were enjoying the pizza, the two youngest tried not to give in to their cravings  Sat beside each other, the maknaes were controlling their urge to grab a bite from the many tasty-looking slices while the older members lightly teased them about it  It became a fight against their own decisions as the two members were on diet and stuck to not caving into the wants  Jungkook even went ahead and held a slice right against V&rsquo;s nose just to see if he would be tempted but the &lsquo;Sweet Night&rsquo; singer stuck to his resolve &nbsp;

Jin&rsquo;s &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; toppings remark

The &lsquo;The Astronaut&rsquo; hitmaker gobbled down the pizza and praised all the mouthwatering toppings as the other members agreed  However, there was one particular comment that made global fans do a double take  Jin raved about the pickles he was eating with his pizza and asked, &ldquo;How do people overseas eat pizza without pickles?&rdquo;  While many questioned his topping choices, others came to his defence saying that he meant radish pickles and not the cucumber ones trying to make the situation better, launching a hilarious discourse across social media about his pick 

The game of 16

BTS started light with a card game where they put their minds to test  Putting their matha and addition skills to test, SUGA was the first one out while the rest fought it out with numbers  Towards the end, as only members Jimin, Jin and RM stayed, the former&rsquo;s move made RM yell out &lsquo;Shibow&rsquo; (fifteen: shib means ten + ow meaning five) making everyone flustered as the pronunciation is too close to a Korean cuss word  They clarified the same amidst fits of laughter and disbelief  The first game&rsquo;s winner was Jimin, followed by the ranks in order: RM, Jin, J-Hope, V, Jungkook and SUGA, who came in last 

The &lsquo;Liar&rsquo; game

BTS played an upgraded version of the famed mafia game as they were divided into two teams in each round: the liar team and the citizens/villagers team  While they all tried their best to fool each other and find out who the actual liars are, it was only more apparent how well the BTS members knew each other and were accustomed to their presence  To add to the fun, each one of them was given electroencephalograph cat ears  As they lied or tried to be cheeky, the ears moved and made them look adorable  When a question about if they liked to take showers frequently or not was raised, they failed to lie and the liar team was found out easily  The next question was about them having fruity faces and though they faltered, it became a hilarious round of guessing who was which fruit  The last question was about dancing when sad and soon the fingers were pointed once again  In the end, the game came to a close with Jungkook being rightfully picked as the liar 

The following week&rsquo;s episode was teased next with more fun games at the expense of the BTS members who are always ready to unleash their funny sides  After the group events, it is time for solo games that will earn the members more points and hopefully, a reward awaits them at the end

The famed variety show was begun by the South Korean septet in 2015  It did not gain the numbers it currently boasts right off the bat as it first started slowly with smaller episodes that introduced the group member&rsquo;s traits to the world  Over time, their charms had the fans hoodwinked, and as the global influence, as well as their amount of fans, grew, so did the interest in their non-music activities, with the primary focus on &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo;  The show took a break of 10 months and returned late last year with special episodes released every few weeks to keep the momentum going

"Social media today definitely has immense power  It can make or break the career or reputation of any artist  While some people like J K  Rowling suffer a backlash from the trolls, others like the K-pop stars keep getting abundance, love, and an ever-increasing fan following
